                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>I come to my work with a technical mind and creative heart. I rely on my experiences in user research and computer programming to give an analytical approach to my design. Additionally, I never forget that I design for people. All design is about making things for others. There's a responsibility to bring a user's perspective when designing for them.</p>
                <p>One area of interest is into microinteractions:. They are the effects and reactions from an interface when a user makes an action. It could be a simple animation or overall change in the system. They not only help a user accomplish a task but also leave an emotional impact about how the process feels. Being intentional about microinteractions can lead to effective visual solutions for interfaces.</p>
