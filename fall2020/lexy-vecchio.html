                <p>Lexy worked on solidifying her thesis project idea. Using her own experience with PTSD as a guide, Lexy will be exploring the topic through a VR escape room game that will allow players without PTSD to experience what it is like using the concept of looping. This looping mechanic will occur on several levels, with various actions, moments and sets to occur over and over with minor changes to give the player the feeling of unease, danger and disorientation. Although only just into the concept phase, Lexy's next steps are to break down what elements of PTSD she would like to include, and the next semester will focus on putting together a Onesheet, game bible, and concept art. </p>

                <p>This semester Lexy has focused on learning the foundations of game design, both from a psychological perspective, considering how games affect those who play them, and from a technical one. The majority of her creative studio work this semester comes in the form of a 2D side scrolling game, <em>Epiphany</em>, which she spent the second half of the semester working on with her development partner, Brandon Mello. The game, which has gone through several stages of development and can be played here:</p>

                <p>In addition to creating all art assets from the game, Lexy also was able to create some of the mechanics of the game and learn different aspects of Unity's software, including animation, Level creation, Masking, and an introduction to the 3D side of the program. </p>

                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Lexy Vecchio is a game developer, filmmaker and artistic director. After earning her BA in Film from Muhlenberg College in 2015, Lexy worked in a variety of roles in the entertainment and technology industry. Through her work she fell in love with world-building through the process of conceptualizing and fabrication. Lexy sought to find a way to combine her passions of digital media with world building and design, and landed on games as the perfect interactive media for her work. Lexy made her film directorial debut with the short film, <em>Curbside Waltz</em> (2017), which examines two children's perspectives on their parent's drug abuse.</p>
                <p>In the fall of 2020, Lexy started as an Master of Fine Arts Candidate and took a position as a graduate assistant with both the Krenicki Institute and as a teaching assistant in the film concentration of the Digital Media and Design Department. She will be an instructor of record in the fall of 2021.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>What is art, anyway? My rebellion started at an early age: I breezed through the rudimentary concepts of classical art and got praised for work I did not care about but looked classically "artistic." I never wanted to be an artist. There was no challenge in it. No energy. No stories. What I did like drawing was fanart. </p>
                <p>Characters and worlds of books, television, film and games became familiar subject matter, and their stories held significantly more meaning for me than the still-lives I was being trained to paint in private art lessons. Soon I was developing my own style of amalgamation, one that drew on both western and eastern influences. I learned to create my own characters, and my own stories. Alongside these stories I began to explore different mediums to work in - literature, comics, theater, and, into college, film. </p>
                <p>When I started applying these skills into my real world jobs, I received a much different reaction than I had from art teachers of my youth. Other people connected with these stories and characters. I realized that rejecting this historically slim notion of who or what was allowed to be artistic is what made my work more interesting - the genre fiction I'd read, the horror movies I'd watched, the games I stayed up playing till midnight. They gave me new tools to think about storytelling through. It's not that I didn't want to be an artist, it was that I had long since learned the conventions and was ready to break them. This is where my art comes from. I want to tell different stories through my work and help my audience live the unknown narrative of the <em>other</em>. Video games, historically, have been looked at with contempt, as a medium that exists solely as frivolous entertainment, despite their unique element of audience agency. Some art critics, such as Jonathan Jones, have said that games can't be art; I intend to make it anyway. </p>
