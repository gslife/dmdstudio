                    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                    <p>I aim to convey the deep respect and curiosity I have for my subjects. I see art, archives, tech, and social science as interdisciplinary opportunities for learning, healing, and activism to improve human rights and ecological conditions.
                        I want to enhance community awareness and access to resources through engagement, documentation, and preservation, especially among stigmatized and disadvantaged groups.</p>
