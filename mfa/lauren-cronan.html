                <p>Through Greenhouse, Lauren assists with design and administrative tasks with the Connecticut Digital Archive (CTDA), a digital preservation repository program, and assists with Sourcery, an archival document delivery app, as well as GLAM Gear which seeks to create an end-to-end, low-cost hardware and open source software workflow for archival digitization projects. </p>

                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>Whether I’m photographing or designing, I aim to convey the deep respect and curiosity I have for my subjects. My goals are to engage, preserve and improve community awareness and access to resources especially among stigmatized and disadvantaged groups. I see art, archives, tech and science as interdisciplinary opportunities for learning, healing and activism to improve human rights and ecological conditions.</p>
