                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Emma Atkinson is a game developer, narrative designer and digital artist. Born in upstate New York, she is currently based in Connecticut. Emma received her BS in Digital Arts and Sciences and in Communications from Clarkson University in 2019. Currently she is an MFA candidate in Digital Media and Design, with a focus on video game design at the University of Connecticut. She is a graduate assistant within the department, and holds positions as a teaching assistant and instructor of record.</p>
                <p>Emma creates interactive experiences that explore perceptions and connections. Her passion for games has led her to work with virtual reality, creating an immersive poem, <em>(if) only you could understand</em>, which was selected for exhibition at the Toronto Digifest in 2019. Her current project for her thesis, <em>when we were</em>, is a virtual reality game exploring the relationship between two sisters as they go back to their childhood house.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>There’s nothing I love more than a good story. The ability to draw in an audience, engaging with them through the characters and narrative. Games allow the audience to take an active role, letting them slay monsters, explore vast unknowns and even shape their own reality. With all these games though, the constant is the player, and the experiences that the players bring into these worlds shape their own story about their experience. Their perspective on a game is unique. Using the affordances of virtual reality, I explore the haptic communication and perceptions created in these digital worlds. </p>
                <p>My work aims to explore the human experience: how we might interact and connect and what our perceptions of those experiences may be. Perspectives and perceptions are the driving force behind my thesis project, <em>when we were</em>. It explores perceptions that characters hold about each other and events based on their memories. Memories are not always an accurate description of how they actually were. But also, like most things, there are sides to every story. As people, we are a collective of memories, and what we remember, or forget, can influence our identity as individuals. By using virtual reality to allow the players to see both character’s sides of the memories, they will ultimately shape their own thoughts on the relationship between the two.</p>
