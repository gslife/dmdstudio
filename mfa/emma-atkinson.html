                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Gideon Slife was born in Athens, Georgia and is currently based in Hartford, Connecticut. Gideon earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Communication from the University of Delaware in 2012 and worked as a front-end web designer for several years. His web design work often involved helping small businesses build their own stories to communicate to their customers. After teaching typography and interactive design for one year at the University of Delaware as an adjunct, he decided to attend the University of Connecticut to pursue a MFA in the Digital Media Design program. Gideon's work focuses on using his skill to tell stories and combining that with digital methods. His interests lay in using these digital narratives to teach and exploring the ways that interaction design can be used to enhance learning. </p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>After teaching at the undergraduate level for a year and having worked as a professional designer with an online education company, I began to wonder: How can digital media best be leveraged to teach? After living with the invention of the computer for thirty years, using those devices have become second-nature, particularly those of college age who have grown up in the digitally connected world. There are methods of interaction that users may be familiar with from games or other digital media (even something as mundane as online shopping) that can help someone learn. I pair these methods with my skills as an illustrator and narrative building to create meaningful, memorable learning experiences.</p>
