                <p>Everyone likes a good story. Narratives are in our blood as human beings. Storytelling is how we find meaning and connections in life. Currently a Media Producer II for UCONN, I tell stories using a wide range of multimedia tools. Whether I use a certain color for a logo design, or a particular soundbite from a video interview, my goal is to engage the audience. I ask myself before each project, How can I tell this story in a compelling way to learn and help people? </p>
                <p>While working in news, I've covered a lot of tough stories. What makes them most difficult is when they are personal. I had a friend and colleague named Alice that I worked with at FOX 61. Everyone loved Alice. She was the news station “mom.” She took everyone under her wing and offered holiday dinners to the new folks that may not make it home to family far away. She befriended many of us and above all she was kind, a refreshing character quality to an otherwise cut-throat industry. While working an early 3am shift, I learned that Alice was killed by her estranged husband in a murder-suicide. To say this was the single most difficult day of my career is a gross understatement. My reporter and I would have to cover this story as we do any other story; it was our journalistic responsibility. We were devasted. </p>
                <p>What I learned through this experience is we have to tell and cover stories, no matter how hard they may be to give others a voice. Unbeknownst to us, Alice quietly suffered domestic abuse for years from the hands of her husband. The night Alice was killed, she was hiding from her husband in a closet, unable to make a sound. She couldn't call 911 for fear he would hear her. At that time in Connecticut, texting 911 didn't exist. Had she been able to text 911 in that moment, the outcome for her could have been different. We were convicted where we stood that others needed to hear Alice's story. In the days that followed, I covered several stories about 911 texting and shared Alice's story to Connecticut lawmakers at the Capitol. After some time, Connecticut made 911 texting available because of the attention we were able to bring to the problem, raising awareness to domestic violence and by sharing the story of our friend Alice. </p>
                <p>Sharon Burke is an Emmy award-winning news journalist and seasoned storyteller moving into the world of documentary filmmaking.

                <p>My passion is to continue to use my platform to give a voice to those who would otherwise have none. </p>
