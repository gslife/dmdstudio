                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Gideon Slife was born in Athens, Georgia and is currently based in Hartford, Connecticut. Gideon earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Communication from the University of Delaware in 2012 and worked as a front-end web designer for several years. His web designs helped small businesses tell their own stories instead of being simply a brochure for services. After teaching typography and interactive design for a year at the University of Delaware as an adjunct, he now attends the University of Connecticut pursuing a MFA in the Digital Media Design program. Gideon’s work focuses on telling stories with digital design and interaction. His interests lie in using these digital narratives to teach and exploring the ways that interaction design can be used to enhance learning.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>The computer has existed as a household device for thirty years and digital literacy has become second-nature, particularly for those of college age who have grown up in our networked world. The mechanics of interaction for games, music discovery, or online shopping are now familiar to millions of people. In 2017, I taught Introduction to Typography and Interaction Design at the undergraduate level. After this experience, I began to explore ways of combining learning with these ideas of digital interaction. Students often learn better when they can get their hands on a subject rather than the concepts remaining abstract. Giving students a sandbox with constraints is better for learning than giving them a blank canvas in the form of Photoshop or InDesign. Coming at learning from this angle, I’m using my skills for storytelling and interactive design to help students see abstract typography concepts more concretely.  </p>
