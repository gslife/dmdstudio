                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Yucheng Hang is a UX/UI designer, creative technologist and multimedia artist. Born in Yangzhou, China, she is currently based in Storrs, Connecticut. She accomplished her BE in Digital Media Technology from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2019. During that time, Yucheng grew interests in the intersection of design and technology. She started to transform emerging technologies to digital experiences resonate with emotion and warmth. With that motivation in mind, she developed creative projects in the area of interaction design, web design and data visualization.</p>
                <p>Yucheng is currently pursuing her MFA degree in Web and Interactive Media Design at University of Connecticut’s Digital Media and Design Department and working as a graduate assistant at Innovation Partnership Building devoting to utilize visual communication to construct bridges between science and arts.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>The Internet redefines our identity. We are all extended ‘digital identity’ online. It is permanent, everywhere and shaping who we are. As the Internet users are getting low age, more and more kids are exposed to the Internet world without instruction and preparation. They lack the awareness to protect and maintain their digital identity positively. I hope to solve this problem, therefore, I am creating an interactive instructional prototype that cultivates kids to be a good digital citizen. By experiencing the prototype, kids are expected to be safe, confident, responsible and kind to explore the online world.</p>
                <p>I firmly believe that pleasant experiences can resonate with emotion and promote the achievement of goals. Therefore, I designed the educational process with game-based experiences in order to immerse children in a world controlled by their own actions. </p>
