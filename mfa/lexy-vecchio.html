                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Lexy Vecchio is a game developer, filmmaker and artistic director. After earning her BA in Film from Muhlenberg College in 2015, Lexy worked in a variety of roles in the entertainment and technology industry. Through her work as a theatrical designer and Prop-Master, she fell in love with world- building through the process of conceptualizing and fabrication. Having worked in the film industry for several years, Lexy sought to find a way to combine her passions of digital media with world building and design, and landed on Games as the perfect interactive media for her work. While working as an assistant teacher with the School of Creative and Performing Arts in New York City, Lexy made her directorial debut. The short film, <em>Curbside Waltz</em> (2017), examines the childhood perspective of living with parental drug abuse.</p>
                <p> In the fall of 2020, Lexy started as an Master of Fine Arts Candidate and took a position as a graduate assistant. Through this role, Lexy works as a researcher with the Krenicki Institute of Arts and Engineering, and as a teaching assistant in the film concentration of Digital Media and Design department, where she will be an instructor of record in the fall of 2021.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>What is art, anyway? My rebellion started at an early age: always ahead of the course work, the rudimentary concepts of art were something I breezed through without really thinking about them; I was often given a check mark on my assignments then handed an art award for work I did not care about but looked classically “artistic.” </p>
                <p>Because of this, I never wanted to be an artist. There was no challenge in it. No meaning, when every piece I made was lauded for being a reproduction of something a dead man had made before me. What I did like drawing was fanart. </p>
                <p>Fanart of characters, worlds and stories held significantly more meaning for me than the still-lives I was being trained to paint in private art lessons. Characters held stories, and the more characters I drew the more stories I developed to go alongside them. Soon I was developing my own style of amalgamation, one that drew on both western and eastern influences to create a diverse array of original characters. I will never forget how, upon seeing the sketched out character designs I had worked on for years, my middle school art teacher sighed and shook his head, giving me the only negative feedback he had ever seen fit to offer:</p>
                <p>“I really wish you would put that much effort into real art, instead of that anime porn stuff.”</p>
                <p>Since then, I have tried to become the bane of my art teacher’s existence. I quit my art classes and stopped drawing for other people altogether, only working on things that I wanted to work on. I rejected an opportunity to spend the summer before my senior year at the Chicago Art institute, complete with a free ride from a high school grant. I learned new skills, moved on to other artistic disciplines such as acting, theater design, and film, all of which helped me to develop my storytelling abilities. Still I doodled my characters in the margins, creating a big fat tome of diverse designs. </p>
                <p>I realize now that what I was really doing was rejecting this historically slim notion of whose style was allowed to be artistic. It wasn’t that I wasn’t an artist, it was that I refused to conform to an accepted standard of art. This is where my art comes from. I want to tell different stories through my work and help my audience live the unknown narrative of the other. This has also informed my choice in medium. Video games, historically, have been looked at with contempt, as a medium that exists solely as frivolous entertainment. Some, such as Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones, have said that games can’t be art;</p>
                <p>I intend to make it anyway. </p>
