                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Maria Raykova is an educational media designer based in the United States. She holds a BA degree in animation and a certificate in instructional design, and is pursuing a MFA degree in Digital Media and Design.</p>
                <p>She is skilled in animation, eLearning development, front-end web design, and video production and editing. In 2019, Maria contributed artwork and animation to five YouTube videos for the popular science channel Veritasium, totaling nearly 100 million views to date. More recently, she worked with faculty and staff at the University of Connecticut to rapidly develop a new online course on the topic of anti-Black racism.</p>
                <p>Maria is currently seeking opportunities to continue communicating important and timely information with the creative use of online media.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>I consider animation to be a powerful tool for education, and my training as an animation filmmaker informs my approach to instructional design. However, my work is not limited to animated content, nor to any particular technique or aesthetic. I am inspired by ideas, not images. So whether I am working on a short animated film, a YouTube video, or an online course, my creative process always begins with the subject matter. </p>
                <p>The subject matter always lies outside my area of expertise, so research and interdisciplinary collaboration are integral to my work. I relish any opportunity to write a script that breaks down a challenging concept to help it reach a new audience. In every science video I’ve worked on, I’ve tried to pull out the emotional or “human” threads that bring the scientific content to life. While the final product will inevitably reflect my personal taste, my top priority as a designer is to communicate the subject matter accurately and effectively. </p>
