                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Alyssa McDonald (b. 1993, Connecticut) is a lifelong Connecticut resident. After receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography from Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 2016, she worked as a studio director for photographers Abelardo Morell and Laura McPhee for four years. As she settled into her positions, working for two artists, she developed a curiosity about the facets of her job that lay outside the confines of photography. She began to take on new roles such as project manager, creative director, social media manager, web designer, and graphic designer. These interests led her to apply to graduate school to further her education. She is currently a first-year MFA candidate at the University of Connecticut, studying Digital Media and Design. She is also a Graduate Research Assistant for Greenhouse Studios, Scholarly Communications Design at the University of Connecticut. Alyssa’s work and research focuses on health experience design in regards to womxn’s physical and emotional well-being.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>At the core of all my passions is a desire to authentically tell stories. My inspiration for my thesis project started with my own story. My story begins the age of twenty-five years old when I found a lump in my breast. No one was concerned about it but me, however I still let my trust in medical professionals overshadow my own intuition. I decided to take charge of my own health and found a capable breast surgeon on my own. Had I not, I would not be in graduate school right now, because the lump in my breast was quickly turning into something far more dangerous than assumed; It was a borderline phyllodes tumor, a rare tumor that accounts for one percent of all breast tumors and is not normally found in womxn my age. Far worse than the physical pain that came with two breast surgeries, were the emotional side effects: I dealt with debilitating anxiety and PTSD; I felt like my body was a ticking time bomb; I was plagued with thoughts about what my life would look like had I not had it removed; I was deeply angry at myself for not doing anything sooner. I had never felt so alone and misunderstood in my life, that is until I joined an online support group for womxn affected by phyllodes tumors. It was there I found that my own story was irrevocably linked to the story of every other woman who has ever felt at war with her own body, and there I found purpose for my pain and the physical and emotional pain endured by the over two thousand womxn who are in that group.</p>
                <p>It was through these stories that I learned and through these stories I felt understood, more so than I did from any medical professional. Too often, a woman’s concerns about her own body are dismissed. Too often, womxn do not receive sufficient healthcare or answers to their questions. Too often, womxn struggle alone. My mission is to change narrative and empower womxn to be the authors of their own story. By connecting womxn to each other through storytelling, I hope to form a collective of information on womxn’s breast health, in particular phyllodes tumors, build knowledge through shared experience, support womxn’s physical and emotional health, and create an environment that is conducive to open, honest conversation.</p>
                <p>I envision this project manifesting in many forms. These forms include, but are not limited to: a mobile app, a website, an interactive experience, video, audio recordings and photography, as to provide a holistic view of the diverse struggles experienced by womxn who are affected by phyllodes tumors, cancers of the breast, breast cancers and other breast diseases. </p>
