                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Alyssa McDonald (b. 1993) is a lifelong Connecticut resident.  She is currently a first-year MFA candidate studying web and interactive media design in Digital Media & Design department at the University of Connecticut.  She is also a Graduate Research Assistant for Greenhouse Studios, at the University of Connecticut.  Alyssa’s work and research focus on health experience design  and womxn’s breast health.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>My inspiration for my work started with my own story.  In 2019 at twenty-five years old I found a lump in my breast.  I had never felt so alone and misunderstood in my life, that is until I joined an online support group for womxn affected by phyllodes tumors.  In this group, I found that my own story was irrevocably linked to the story of every other womxn who has ever felt at war with her own body.  It was there I found my purpose.  Too often, a womxn’s concerns about her own body are dismissed.  Too often, womxn do not receive sufficient healthcare or answers to their questions.  Too often, womxn struggle alone.  My mission is to change narrative and empower womxn to be the authors of their own story.  By connecting womxn to each other via a mobile app, I hope to form a collective of information on womxn’s breast health, in particular phyllodes tumors, build knowledge through shared experience, support womxn’s physical and emotional health, and create a safe environment that is conducive to open, honest conversation.</p>
