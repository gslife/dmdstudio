                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Matthew Mullin is an American graphic designer with six years of industry experience. He received a BA in 2014 from Bridgewater State University, majoring in Graphic Design and minoring in Art History, and is currently pursuing an MFA at the University of Connecticut in Digital Media & Design. Largely working in the nonprofit sector, Mullin’s past work has centered around early childhood education, as well as land and wildlife conservation.</p>
                <p>In his most recent role with The Trustees of Reservations, Mullin was the recipient of the Green Light Award for his strong commitment to focus and accountability. While there, he worked primarily with printed marketing materials such as mailers, publications, and event collateral targeted toward members and donors. His current work is rooted in UX/UI design, where he aims to create visually engaging user interfaces that amplify nonprofits’ outreach efforts.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>My work has progressed into combatting contemporary trends that unconsciously douse each canvas in white, creating an endless void of vibrancy or innovation. Using bold colors, my goal has been to have each design burst into bloom, leaving a lasting impact. My methods include incorporating organic shapes that result in each edge flowing into the other, and collectively these elements work to foster an aura of comfort and unity; an approach that has proved beneficial to my work in the nonprofit sector.</p>
                <p>Using design as a means to do good has become my unwavering mission. I am determined to captivate awareness, create social change, and tap into others’ internal emotions and feelings through design. In my current work, my goal is to implement UX/UI practices more seamlessly within nonprofit settings to create intuitive interfaces that nurture a more intimate experience for the user. This, in turn, converts curious onlookers into passionate activists and recurring donors.</p>
                <p>My philosophy toward my craft has always been the same–approach each blank canvas with integrity, but never be afraid to shake things up for the sake of creativity. Styles, techniques, and trends come and go like the tides; enjoy each moment, and never compromise innovation.</p>
