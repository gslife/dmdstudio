                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Michael Toomey is an interactive media designer from Windham, Connecticut. His work combines digital interactive media with interactive hardware to create immersive environments. He served as the digital media and experience producer for a two-story interactive media wall installed in the lobby of the Boston Children’s Hospital. The project utilized motion tracking to allow guests to become characters in over 20 different interactive environments displayed on the wall. He is currently working on the first of a series of immersive interactive experiences aimed at k-8 education. He earned his BA from the University of Connecticut, with an independent major titled “Interactive Multimedia.” He is currently working on his MFA in Digital Media & Design, also at the University of Connecticut.</p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>I combine interactive digital media within themed physical environments to create interactive immersive experiences. Inspired by the Imagineers of the Disney World and Disneyland parks, and the artists, architects, and engineers who create movie sets, I aim to create immersive environments that feel aspirational to viewers. To create a believable experience, my immersive environments must feel real, safe and familiar, while at the same time, transporting viewers into new imaginative worlds.</p>
                <p>My current work, “Deep Sea Journey” aims at creating educational adventures for K-8 grade students. A submarine themed environment, Deep Sea Journey, allows students to take an immersive, virtual adventure into the depths of the ocean.</p>
                <p>Successful art must tell a story. I aim to invite the viewer to be an active participant within the world that I create and allow them to control the direction of their journey and the outcome of the story. No two run throughs of the experience will be exactly the same. The viewer’s participation affects the flow of the story.</p>
                <p>My goal with this project is to inspire students and to ignite their imaginations.</p>
