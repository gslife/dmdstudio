                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Wenchao Lou (b. 1997, China) is a game designer, visual designer and UI/UX designer. She graduated from The State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY) with a bachelor's degree in Media Studies and a game design certificate in 2017; during this time she discovered a love for digital media and game design involving immersive experiences, board games, electronic literature and 3D media. This passion drove Wenchao to enter the Master of Fine Arts program in Digital Media and Design from University of Connecticut to further study game design. During her program she also served as a Graduate Assistant in Greenhouse Studios, fostering meaningful work using digital tools as a medium. Now she is working on her 2D cooking game related to Chinese food culture and memory. </p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>The cathartic emotions and sorrows of game narrative affect the hearts of players. There are very few small games where cooking is guided by stories. Why not celebrate my culture through sharing traditional Chinese cooking with America. My work "(game name right here)" is a small cooking game seasoned with memories of my family as a child. The game has players accomplish tasks to unlock my story. Everyone’s memories and menus of family members are unique. I hope this game can bring players into my home and share my family’s food and story. Also let them remember the good time with their families.</p>
