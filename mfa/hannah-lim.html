                <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
                <p>Hongju Lim is a South Korean film maker and a character animator who focuses on telling stories about twenty something and children.</p>
                <p>She graduated from Chung-Ang University(2019/Seoul, South Korea) with a BA in Film Studies and minor major in Game and Interactive Media. She is currently a second-year M.F.A. candidate and graduate assistant studying 3D animation, with a focus in character animation.</p>
                <p>She has directed two short films “Akmong”, “ON Time” and collaborated on numerous other short films as a synchronous recordist. </p>
                </p>
                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>The main goal of my work is to bring smiles to adults who feel mundane in their daily life . </p>
                <p>Animation is a great medium that can make this happen. I believe character animation is one of the most important factors that connect the audience to the story. Movement and expression give joy to the audience and enhance the attraction of the contents. </p>
                <p>Character animating is what brings me passion and inspiration when making stories that makes others smile. As a filmmaker, I was mostly attracted to editing staging of the production. I like how the impact of a scene can differ by how shots; length, speed, or size is edited with sounds and effects. My editing experience has translated into character animation. Playing with timing of the movement is similar to building rhythm in video editing. If the movements are tedious I try to figure out other movements that make it look entertaining. If I’m not satisfied with a movement, I keep making corrections until a scene looks completely natural.</p>
                <p>Most of my work relates to children. I sometimes get into thoughts that I’ve gotten old but have never grown up inside. When I get deep with my memories, the young child feels more like myself than I am today. Writing stories with children or characters that have characteristics of children helps me to talk about me. With my experience in making films, I want to connect them with the 3D field and find a new and better way to convey stories to the audience.</p>
